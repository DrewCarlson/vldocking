== And now... Docking ! ==

Here is the receipe to transform our application into a docking-enabled application :
- Have the GUI blocks (our four components) implement the Dockable interface
- Install a DockingDesktop on our Frame
- Add the dockables into the desktop.

  So let's start...

== Implement the Dockable interface ==

The Dockable interface is simple : you just have two methods :

{{{
    public DockKey getDockKey();
    public Component getComponent();
}}}

  The DockKey is the JavaBean that contains presentation and behaviour informations
  about the dockable (name, icon, ...) and a special <b>key</b> field used as
  a primary key for loading and saving <i>
  ( <img src="/images/buttons/v2.jpg" title="new feature from VLDocking 2.0">
  this field was formerly known as 'dockName' but
  we have replaced it with a more comprehensive naming)</i>.

  We will use the most simple constructor, which takes only one argument : key.

  So let's look at one of the four GUI blocks and have it implement Dockable :

{{{
    class MyTextEditor extends JPanel <b>implements Dockable </b>{

        <b>DockKey key = new DockKey("textEditor");</b>

        JTextArea textArea = new JTextArea("A Text Area");
        public MyTextEditor() {
            setLayout(new BorderLayout());
            JScrollPane jsp = new JScrollPane(textArea);
            jsp.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(200, 400));
            add(jsp, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        }
        <b>public DockKey getDockKey(){
            return key;
        }
        public Component getComponent(){
            return this;
        }</b>
    }
}}}

  As you can see, we have added an instance variable <code>key</code> to identify
  our component. We also return <code>this</code> for the getComponent() method, which
  indicates that the Dockable IS the component (we could have created non GUI dockables to
  isolate them from the application code, but this is our first lesson...).

  We leave the implementation of Dockable on the three other components as an exercice to
  the reader (who can also find it on the final sources of the tutorial).

== Install the DockingDesktop ==

  This step is easy, just create an instance variable on the MyFirstFrame object :


{{{
<b>import com.vlsolutions.swing.docking.*;</b>

public class MyFirstFrame extends JFrame {
   MyTextEditor editorPanel = new MyTextEditor();
   MyTree treePanel = new MyTree();
   MyGridOfButtons buttonGrid = new MyGridOfButtons();
   MyJTable tablePanel = new MyJTable();

   <b>DockingDesktop desk = new DockingDesktop();</b>

   public MyFirstFrame(){
      setDefaultCloseOperation(DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);
      <b>getContentPane().add(desk);</b> // desk becomes the only one component
      <s>getContentPane().add(editorPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER); </s>
      <s>getContentPane().add(treePanel, BorderLayout.WEST);</s>
      <s>getContentPane().add(buttonGrid, BorderLayout.NORTH);</s>
      <s>getContentPane().add(tablePanel, BorderLayout.EAST);</s>
   }
}
}}}


== Build the desktop ==
There are two ways to build your desktop : 
 - Static : define and load a workspace with the help of the Workspace Editor application.
 - Dynamic : invoke the API to create or update your desktop layout.



=== The (dynamic) DockingDesktop API ===


  The DockingDesktop uses a relative positionning API : Look at the following code
  and guess what it does...

{{{

  desk.addDockable(editorPanel);
  desk.split(editorPanel, treePanel, DockingConstants.SPLIT_LEFT);
  desk.split(editorPanel, buttonGrid, DockingConstants.SPLIT_RIGHT);
  desk.split(buttonGrid, tablePanel, DockingConstants.SPLIT_BOTTOM);
}}}


  Here is a screenshot of the results :

       <img src="/images/tutorial/frame2.jpg"><br>
       A basic workspace...

  Easy, isn't it ? let's decode it :
== Docking layout methods ==

=== The <code>addDockable</code> method ===

  This method is used to set the initial component of the desktop.

=== The <code>split</code> method ===

 The <code>split(Dockable base, Dockable newDockable, DockingConstants.Split position) </code> method
    is used to position a dockable (<code>newDockable</code>) relative to another (the <code>base</code>), and with
    respect to a positionning (<code>DockingConstants.SPLIT_TOP, SPLIT_LEFT, SPLIT_BOTTOM, SPLIT_RIGHT</code>).

    The <code>position</code> parameter designates the <b> orientation </b> and <b> order </b> of the added component (SPLIT_TOP, for example, means : split the <code>base</code> container vertically, and put the <code>newDockable</code> on the upper part).

=== The <code>createTab</code> method ===

The <code>createTab(Dockable base, Dockable newDockable, int order)</code> method is used to put two (or more) dockables at the same position on the desktop by creating a tabbed pane.

  If a tabbed pane is already created, a new tab is added at the <code>order</code> index.

=== The <code>setAutoHide</code> method ===

 <code>setAutoHide(Dockable d, boolean hidden)</code> is used to auto-hide an already
 visible dockable. So, you first add, split or createTab a dockable to display it, and
 then you hide it (that way, it will remember where to be displayed when docked again).

=== The <code>setFloating</code> method ===

 <code>setFloating(Dockable d, boolean float)</code> is used to detach a dockable
 and display it in its own window. If <code>float</code> is false, than the floating
 dockable is attached again to its desktop.

 Making a dockable floating is allowed when the dockable is already visible and "docked",
 or if it is auto-hidden.

=== The <code>maximize</code> and <code>restore</code> methods ===

 These methods allow you to maximize a dockable (have it take the full size of its desktop, hiding the others dockable) and to put it back where it was before (restore). 

 Making a dockable maximized is allowed when the dockable is already visible and "docked".

=== The <code>addHiddenDockable</code> method ===

  <code>addHiddenDockable(Dockable d, RelativeDockingPosition restorePosition)</code> is used to auto-hide a dockable that is not visible.

  The RelativeDockingPosition defines a restore  position (x,y, width, height : values between 0.0 and 1.0) where the component  will be displayed when removed from  its autohide border.

   You can use constants like  <code>RelativeDockingPosition.TOP_LEFT</code> to express
   this position or  construct a new position (look at the RelativeDockingPosition javadoc API for further   explanations).

=== The <code>registerDockable</code> method ===

  <code> registerDockable(Dockable d)</code> is used to declare a dockable without displaying  it. You will see later on that there is a <code>DockingSelectorDialog</code> helper window that can  be used to select the dockables to show and those to set unvisible, and which requires  registered Dockables (registration is implicit for visible dockables).

=== Screenshots ===

  And here are some images showing the effects of those methods :

    DockingConstants.SPLIT_LEFT);

    DockingConstants.SPLIT_RIGHT);

    <td rowspan="2">
      <pre>
desk.addDockable(editorPanel);
// the tree panel is auto-hidden 
// and will be restored (docked) 
// on the left of the DockingDesktop
desk.addHiddenDockable(treePanel, 
    RelativeDockablePosition.LEFT);
desk.split(editorPanel, buttonGrid, 
    DockingConstants.SPLIT_RIGHT);
desk.split(editorPanel, tablePanel, 
    DockingConstants.SPLIT_LEFT);

      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><img src="/images/tutorial/frame5.jpg"></td></tr>
</table>

== The Dockable Containers ==

  You can see from the screenshots, or from your personal tests, that your dockables have
  been decorated : They all have a title bar with buttons, and a nice shadow border
  around them (Docking 1.1 style) or <img src="/images/buttons/v2.jpg" title="new feature from VLDocking 2.0">
  a simpler flat border (Docking 2.0 style). 
<p>
  This is because when a dockable is added to a DockingDesktop, it is first included
  into a <code>DockableContainer </code> then this component is added to the desktop.
<p>
  DockableContainers are specialized components belonging to the Framework, that are
  replaceable (in order to provide a custom look and feel, or to add new features). <br>
  You usually don't interact with them but simply command their behaviour through the DockKey's properties (this is
  the subject of the next lesson).
<p>
  There are basically two types of DockableContainers :
  <ul>
    <li> <code>SingleDockableContainer</code> is a container for one (and only one) Dockable.
    <li> <code>TabbedDockableContainer</code> is a container that behaves like a JTabbedPane, displaying
     many Dockables on tabs, with always one Dockable selected and visible, on top of the others.
   </ul>
