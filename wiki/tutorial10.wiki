<h1>Lesson 10 : Compound Dockables</h1>
<p>
This is the 10th part of the VLDocking Framework for Java Swing applications.
<p> 
This lesson covers the Compound Dockables, which give a means to create nested hierarchy of dockables.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><img src="/images/buttons/v2.1.jpg" title="new feature from VLDocking 2.1">
Compound dockable containers is a feature available since VLDocking 2.1.
<p>
This feature adds support for nested containers, for example a Tabbed container in which would be nested splitted dockables.

<h2>How does it work ?</h2>
<p>
VLDocking now contains a specialized Dockable, called CompoundDockable.
<p>
Unlike Dockable which is an interface, CompondDockable is a class, and it comes 
with an associated Component : the CompoundDockingPanel. There shouldn't be any 
need to subclass CompoundDockable.
<p>
You interact with CompoundDockable through its DockKey, which gives you a means 
to name it, to give it an icon and a tooltip (as that what's DockKeys are meant to be...).
<p>
Nesting dockables is performed with the new DockingDesktop method 
<code>addDockable(CompoundDockable base, Dockable dockable)</code> which can be used 
to start nesting, and then standard <code>split()</code> or <code>createTab()</code> 
methods can be used to alter the layout of the nested components.
<p>
<h3>Example : creating a tab containing two dockable (horizontal split)</h3>
<div class="example">
<pre>
DockingDesktop desk = ...
Dockable tab1 = ...;
Dockable tab2 = ...;
CompoundDockable compound = new CompoundDockable(new DockKey("Nested"));
Dockable nested1 = ...;
Dockable nested2 = ...;
desk.addDockable(tab1);
desk.createTab(tab1, tab2, 1);
desk.createTab(tab1, compound, 2); // compound is added as a tab
desk.addDockable(compound, nested1); // now we insert nested1
desk.split(nested1, nested2, DockingConstants.SPLIT_RIGHT); // and we split it
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Of course, another way of dealing with nested dockable is to use the 
<a href="http://www.vlsolutions.com/en/products/docking/workspace.php">Workspace Manager Application </a>
and load directly your layout from a workspace XML stream.
